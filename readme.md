                <div class="">
                  <h1 class="text-lg">${serviceTitle}</h1>
                  <p class="text-[#5c5c5c] text-lg">${serviceNumber}</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p class="text-lg">${timeString}</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        `
        const carContainer = callId('cart-container')
        carContainer.append(newCart)

3. What is  Event Bubbling  and how does it work?
Ans: Event Bubbling means when an event happens on a child element, it also travels up to its parent elements.

4. What is  Event Delegation  in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Ans: Event Delegation means you attach the event to a parent and handle its children through it.

5. What is the difference between  preventDefault() and stopPropagation()  methods?
